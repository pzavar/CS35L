I studied the window that pops up and referred to my TA's slides to find the answers:

Top-left: the commits added. In order:
-current commit (HEAD)
-local branch "master"
-remote branch master on origin
-commit message

Top-middle: commit authors

Top-right: dates of the commits being added

Middle until bottom:
-used to go to the next and previous commits
-search box for the commits
-the diff and ChangeLog entries
-used to select what diff files to see in first window
-file changes in diff format
-files impacted by selected commit
