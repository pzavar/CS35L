1. To check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository into the new
branch "quote":
cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

2. Installing my change to the new branch and running the patch command 
with the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt as input:
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

3. I studied the add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) function

4. I open the ChangeLog file and implement the above command. I then
note what I did in the lab to the .c files (changed ' to ` in the appropriate
places)
*see lab9.txt for more details on the exact changes

5. I commit the changes to the new branch:
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

6. Using the given command, I generate a file formatted-patch.txt:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

7. I emailed my patch to Jonathan and he emailed his to me.
git am < JohnPatch.txt
./bootstrap
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff (since I was in lnxsrv9)
patch -p0 < ../diffutils-gets.diff
(I need the above patch as I was in lnxsrv09)
make
make check

8. To verify that the ChangeLog works:
make distdir
cd diffutils-3.0.1-35c1 
emacs ChangeLog

9. I have Xqartz running and enable X11 forwarding in my PuTTy settings:
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk
