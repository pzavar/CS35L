3. We cannot output random lines on the given file. The compiler gives an error "IndexError: list index out of range" when calling the chooseline function.
We are not specifying the number of lines to be zero and the /dev/null file doesn't have any lines, so the compiler throws the error.

4. It yields the following when I ran it on python3:
"[hajzavar@lnxsrv06 ~]$ python3 randline.py
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
[hajzavar@lnxsrv06 ~]$
"
This is based on the changes made to Python3 that were not evident in Python2.
The line throwing the error "except IOError as (errno, strerror):" is the problem.
For it to work on Python3, it should be the following:
"except OSError as err:"
